Add a cool and bold Responsive Menu in your WordPress site using Responsive Bold Navigation. It also supports Font Awesome Icons. 

== Description ==

A simple and lightweight plugin based on the 3D Bold Navigation article by <a href="https://codyhouse.co/demo/3d-bold-navigation/index.html">Codyhouse</a>. I used Font-Awesome for the Icons. 


*Setting Up the Menu*
<ul>
<li>Activate the plugin</li>
<li>Go to WordPress Dashboard >> Apperence >> Menus</li>
<li>Create a new menu or change the existing menu location to "RB Menu"</li>
<li>Check the video below for adding icon to your Menu</li>

</ul>
